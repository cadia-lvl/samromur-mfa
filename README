# Preparation for Montreal Forced Alignment with Samromur dataset
This tool is to align and segmentate a dataset of audio files to prepare it for Kaldi. 

The input is a folder with multiple speakers, for which there are one or several audio file. An audio file is made up of a sentence, spoke in Icelandic. To use this tool, the data has to be in this form :

'''

│   ├── id_user_1-id_file_1.flac
│   ├── id_user_1-id_file_2.flac
│   └── id_user_1-id_file_3.flac
├── id_user_2/
│   ├── id_user_2-id_file_4.flac
